- [[Abstract]]
	- The goals and objectives of this guide are to:
	  Provide a practical, cross domain guidance with examples, to enable 
	  organizations to integrate the concepts contained in the NRM into their 
	  organizationâ€™s plans, processes, and work instructions.
	  Provide support for practitioners to ensure effective NRDM over the project lifecycle.
	  Provide organizations guidance that can be used to successfully implement NRDM processes within their Systems Engineering (SE) activities at the proper level that best fits their culture, workforce, processes, and domain. 
	  Present methods to implement a data-centric approach of NRDM across the system lifecycle.
	  Help practitioners understand why effective lifecycle concept and needs definition is necessary prior to successfully performing the requirements definition activities.
