- [[Abstract]]
	- While a variety of “product” modularity measures have been proposed and empirically used, little comparative research has been conducted on the characteristics and efficacy of such measures. This study explores how the use of diverse modularity measures affects the analysis of the “mirroring” hypothesis. Particularly, this study analyzes the relationship between “product” modularity measures and the degree of: 1) buyer-supplier integration in new product development; 2) supply chain configuration. The empirical results suggest which of the analyzed measures of modularity are preferable, question the overall utility of such measures to really understand the organizational implications of complex technological systems, and point to alternative measurement approaches.
