- [[Abstract]]
	- Product managers drive the vision, strategy, design, and execution of their product. While one can often quickly comprehend the basic responsibilities of the role, mastering each of these dimensions is truly an art form that one is constantly honing. In this presentation I'll share my lessons learned over the last decade as a product manager in Silicon Valley on the art behind each of these dimensions of product management.
	   
	  Sachin Rekhi is a serial entrepreneur and product leader who has spent the last decade developing innovative products in Silicon Valley.
	   
	  Sachin most recently founded Connected, a professional contact manager that was acquired by LinkedIn in 2011 and re-launched as LinkedIn Contacts. He went on become head of product for LinkedIn Sales Navigator, LinkedIn's flagship offering for sales professionals.
	   
	  Prior to Connected, Sachin founded Anywhere.FM, a web music player that allowed users to upload, play, and discover music online, which was acquired by imeem in 2008. Sachin started his career at Microsoft as a product lead on Visual Studio, Microsoft's developer tools platform.
	   
	  Sachin recently left LinkedIn and has been advising early-stage startups on product strategy, design, and growth.
