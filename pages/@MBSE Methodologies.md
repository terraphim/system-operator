- [[Abstract]]
	- A Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) methodology can be characterized as the collection of related processes, methods, tools, and environment used to support the discipline of systems engineering in a “model-based” or “model-driven” context. In this chapter, a cursory description of some of the leading MBSE methodologies used in industry today is provided. It is expected that during an organization’s candidate MBSE methodology assessment process (including impact to native processes and procedures), a tool survey and assessment will occur concurrently or shortly thereafter, followed by selection and piloting of relevant tools. This latter effort requires participation from the organization’s systems engineering practitioner community because that is the community that will most heavily be using the tools. Although a tool survey is beyond the scope of this chapter, guidance and a novel technique for MBSE methodology assessment is provided. In addition, future directions and areas of standardization of various MBSE methodologies is also described.
