- [[Abstract]]
	- The next evolution of the INCOSE Competency Framework is Version 0.75. This paper describes some of the major sections of the Version 0.75 document. One of the major sections describes the updated competency framework structure which has evolved into competence groups and core competence areas. Another section is a draft guide to role definition that describes the typical roles that systems engineers may assume. One major section discusses some use cases with a detailed look at recruitment, education program improvement and professional development. The document includes a section that explains how to tailor the competency framework to suit using organizations. This paper concludes by exploring all the remaining coordination activities and other actions required to successfully develop and publish Version 1.0 of the new INCOSE Competency Framework.
