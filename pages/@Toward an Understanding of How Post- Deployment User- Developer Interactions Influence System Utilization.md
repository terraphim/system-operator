- [[Abstract]]
	- Although initial adoption of an information system has been shown to influence system success, further value can be obtained when end-users move beyond adoption, utilizing more features of the system and integrating it into their work routines. Organizations can increase the post-deployment utilization of their systems by emphasizing continued interaction between developers and end-users. In this study, we develop a research model investigating the influence of shared understanding, faithfulness of appropriation, and consensus on spirit on post-deployment system utilization. Using a sample from a healthcare organization, we show that increased end-user postdeployment interaction with developers supports a shared understanding between the two groups, which ultimately impacts both the routinization and infusion of a system. This study provides a contribution by demonstrating the impact of developer/user interaction in the post-implementation phase of systems development.
