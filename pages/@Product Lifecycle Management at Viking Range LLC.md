- [[Abstract]]
	- This case study describes the strategy implemented by Viking Range, LLC as they implemented a PLM strategy to unify multiple engineering departments into one engineering organization. While the company was not burdened by as much legacy data as some implementations, considerable constraints existed within the company with respect to resource allocation and not delaying the launch of new products. The author addresses typical PLM challenges and change management strategies and how Viking Range overcame these challenges. The case study ends with advice to readers who wish to implement a PLM strategy within their own company.
