- [[Abstract]]
	- There are unique challenges to developing organizational capability in government R&D organizations that support specialized national missions. The complex nature of developing capabilities in these organizations is highlighted and research questions and challenges are posed. In particular, two broad challenges identified in this paper – 1) being able to understand the enterprise well enough to identify likely impacts of contemplated decisions and 2) being able to coordinate planning and decision making amongst stakeholders across the enterprise – are explored. Systems engineering literature is used as the basis for exploring the challenges from multiple perspectives. The intention of this paper is to provide an adequate description of the challenges, discuss some strategies that have been tried or proposed, and engage in a dialogue with the systems engineering community about other experiences in addressing the complexity of managing and evolving government R&D capability.
