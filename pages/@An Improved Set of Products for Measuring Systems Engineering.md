- [[Abstract]]
	- This paper provides information on the INCOSE Measurement Technical Committee and its three working groups. The charter and goals are presented along with objectives for development and support of measurement products. Significant milestone events for both products and product support services are provided – the only products to receive approval, or interim approval, of the INCOSE Technical Board were developed within the Measurement Technical Committee. A brief description is provided of each of the measurement products developed to date. A synopsis of the past year's activities is provided along with planned future activities. An integrated approach to development of measurement products is being pursued to permit more effective measurement and improvement of systems engineering activities. The products developed by the Measurement Technical Committee are available to become an integral part of the strategic planning activities of both industry and government.
