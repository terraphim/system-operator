- [[Abstract]]
	- The world is going through rapid and deep technological change. With advances due to new uses of the Internet and electronic devices, the relationships between companies and their customers will be improved in a way never seen before. These changes will allow products to communicate with their manufacturers (the Voice of the Product) so that they can be improved in future generations and can also be supported with updates made remotely, without user intervention. Productivity increases, continuous improvement and improved customer relationship are the objectives of this paradigm shift. Products from all durable and non-durable segments will have a high level of customisation, with the customer being responsible for specifying which characteristics will satisfy them.
