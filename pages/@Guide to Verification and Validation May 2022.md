- [[Abstract]]
	- Design input requirements and the integrated set of needs from which they were transformed form the backbone of the Systems Engineering (SE) effort for the SOI being developed. Design and system verification and system validation activities are intended to supply evidence that those needs and design input requirements will be, or have been, met. This is crucial and necessary, to ensure that the designed SOI as built, not only meets the design input requirements (system verification) but is also suitable for its intended use in its operational environment when operated by its intended users and validating that unintended use, or “rogue” users cannot prevent the SOI from meeting its intended use as defined by the integrated set of needs or use the SOI in an unintended way.
