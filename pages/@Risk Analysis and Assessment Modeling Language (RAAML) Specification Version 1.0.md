- [[Abstract]]
	- The RAAML Version 1.0 specification defines extensions to SysML needed to support safety and reliability analysis. It provides the modeling capabilities for tool vendors to build safety and reliability modeling tools that provide traditional representations (e.g. trees, tables, etc.) while using a modern model-based approach. The RAAML specification can provide the foundation for conducting various safety and quality engineering activities including safety and reliability analysis methods. Besides the method support, linkages to the SysML model-of-interest are provided, enabling integration with and traceability to the analyses. The spec describes the RAAML core concepts and shows: ? That simple concepts are powerful enough to unite all safety and reliability information across a variety of analysis methods, ? The approach to automating several safety and reliability analyses, which is built on leveraging existing SysML functionalities to ensure that the profile and library is usable with existing tooling, ? Specific safety and reliability analysis methods and application domains that are supported, including FMEA, FTA, STPA, GSN, ISO 26262 Road Vehicles Functional Safety, and Extension Mechanisms that are typically needed by the industry to apply the specification in practice.
