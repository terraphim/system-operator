- [[Abstract]]
	- The Project Breakdown Structure (PBS), commonly referred to as a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), if built correctly, is a hugely powerful tool for definition of products and services, costing, scheduling, assignment of responsibility, measuring, reporting, organizational design, and risk management in
	  technical projects. To realize these benefits, the PBS/WBS must be product oriented, i.e., strongly oriented towards the physical structure of the end products to be delivered by the project. Simple, proven sets of rules for building the structure are presented. Available standards and guides on PBS/WBS are overviewed and advice is provided on their use.
