- [[Abstract]]
	- The Bio/Pharmaceutical industry is at an interesting crossroads regarding the use of electronic technologies in laboratories. Laboratory management and staff must often evaluate tools that they don't completely understand, while facing pressure from vendors trying to make a sale. Furthermore, regulatory agencies are requiring senior management to justify the application of scientific electronic technology. Computerized Systems in the Modern Laboratory will provide laboratory staff and managers a solid understanding of the tools available, how to successfully purchase and implement the technology, and how to develop a plan for application and evaluation in order to meet regulatory requirements.
