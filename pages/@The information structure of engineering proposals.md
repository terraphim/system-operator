- [[Abstract]]
	- The paper reports on the results of an ancillary study, arising out of a PhD research project about aerospace engineerspsila language in the workplace. The analysis shows that information in engineering proposals could be accounted for by a set of 39 discrete information types, called dasiaproposal componentspsila (PCs), belonging to four mutually-exclusive information categories. These are centred on the following foci: product (or solution); company, including engineering personnel; customer (and product) support; meta-discourse. This study suggests how data derived from analysing patterns of information structure may help engineers to evaluate past proposals, both successful and unsuccessful, with a view to improving future proposal documents.
