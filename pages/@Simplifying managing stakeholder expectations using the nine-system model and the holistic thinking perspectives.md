	- Abstract. The problems of stakeholder management and requirements elicitation and elucidation are complex and sometimes the roles, responsibilities and areas of concern seem difficult to identify and integrate. This paper addresses those issues and describes a systemic and systematic way of simplifying stakeholder management and requirements elicitation and elucidation in a situational example using the:  Holistic Thinking Perspectives (HTP) to identify stakeholders.  Nine-System Model to sort stakeholders and identify their areas of concern in order to translate their expectations into system requirements. The paper also introduces the concept of direct and indirect stakeholders in addition to internal and external stakeholders.
