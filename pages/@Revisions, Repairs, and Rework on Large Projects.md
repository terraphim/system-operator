- [[Abstract]]
	- The effects of revisions, repairs, and rework on large, complex projects are very substantial and are not frequently dealt with in a comprehensive, consistent, or effective manner, even in industries that deal constantly with very large projects, such as the commercial nuclear power industry. Large‚Äêscale commercial nuclear projects require multiple work phases and disciplines that result in substantial and significant interdependencies among these work phases and disciplines. These interdependencies and the complex interactions that result are key factors in understanding, controlling, and managing such projects. Of particular relevance are the consequences of these interdependencies upon effective project work scope caused by revisions, repairs, and rework. This study examines these effects using a simplified mathematical model constructed to correspond with intuitive reasoning and empirical observations. A range of hypothetical examples is also provided to illustrate the consequences of these effects.
