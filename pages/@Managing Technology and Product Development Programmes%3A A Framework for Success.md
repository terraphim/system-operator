- [[Abstract]]
	- An authoritative guide to new product development for early career engineers and engineering students
	  
	  Managing Technology and Product Development Programmes provides a clear framework and essential guide for understanding how research ideas and new technologies are developed into reliable products which can sold successfully in the private or business marketplace. Drawing on the authorâ€™s practical experience in a variety of engineering industries, this important book fills a gap in the product development literature. It links back into the engineering processes that drives the actual creation of products and represents the practical realisation of innovation.
	  
	  Comprehensive in scope, the book reviews all elements of new product development. The topics discussed range from the economics of new product development, the quality processes, prototype development, manufacturing processes, determining customer needs, value proposition and testing. Whilst the book is designed with an emphasis on engineered products, the principles can be applied to other fields as well. This important resource: 
	  
	  Takes a holistic approach to new product development
	  Links technology and product development to business needs
	  Structures technology and product development from the basic idea to the completed off-the-shelf product
	  Explores the broad range of skills and the technical expertise needed when developing new products
	  Details the various levels of new technologies and products and how to track where they are in the development cycle
	  Written for engineers and students in engineering, as well as a more experienced audience, and for those funding technology development, Managing Technology and Product Development Programmes offers a thorough understanding of the skills and information engineers need in order to successfully convert ideas and technologies into products that are fit for the marketplace.
