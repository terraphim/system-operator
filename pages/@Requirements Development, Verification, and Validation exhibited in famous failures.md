- [[Abstract]]
	- Requirements Development, Requirements Verification, Requirements Validation, System Verification, and System Validation are important systems engineering tasks. This paper describes these tasks and then discusses famous systems where these tasks were done correctly and incorrectly. This paper shows examples of the differences between developing requirements, verifying requirements, validating requirements, verifying a system, and validating a system. Understanding these differences may help increase the probability of success of future system designs. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Syst Eng 8: 1–14, 2005
