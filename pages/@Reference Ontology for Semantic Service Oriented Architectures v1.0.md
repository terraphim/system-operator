- [[Abstract]]
	- This Reference Ontology for Semantic Service Oriented Architectures is an abstract framework for understanding significant entities and relationships between them within a Semantically-enabled Service-Oriented environment. It may be leveraged for the development of related standards or specifications supporting that environment, as well as guiding efforts to realize concrete solutions.
	  This Reference Ontology builds on the OASIS Reference Model for Service Oriented Architecture (SOA-RM) and combines it with the key concepts of semantics that are relevant for Semantically-enabling Service Oriented Architectures.
	  A reference model is not directly tied to any standards, technologies or other concrete implementation details. It does seek to provide a common understanding that can be used unambiguously across and between different implementations. The relationship between this Reference Ontology, the SOA Reference Model, and particular architectures, technologies and other aspects of SOA is illustrated in Figure 1.
	  Just as the SOA-RM, this reference ontology focuses on the field of software architecture. The concepts and relationships described may apply to other "service" environments; however, this specification makes no attempt to completely account for use outside of the software domain.
