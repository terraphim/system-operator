- [[Abstract]]
	- The project FALCON aims to deploy user experiences and user data collected via the Internet of Things (IoT) and social media for improvement of product-service systems (PSS). Customers play no longer a passive role in the product and service development process as they express their product and service experiences and opinions through social media. In addition, sensor systems in combination with products incorporated in the IoT, are becoming increasingly common. The potential endless amounts of available information offer a rich ground for value creation in the product-service innovation chain. Accordingly, FALCON will develop a Virtual Open Platform to seamlessly connect product-service usage information to design and development processes.
