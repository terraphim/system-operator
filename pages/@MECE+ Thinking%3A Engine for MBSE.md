- [[Abstract]]
	- In the experience of this author, most systems engineering practitioners are familiar with ModelBased Systems Engineering (MBSE) in some form. Many practitioners have learned SysML or another
	  modeling language and have experience in populating a few of the standard diagrams from within a
	  commercial MBSE tool. However, few practitioners have had the time or inclination to think deeply
	  about the common principles that “power” the prevailing modeling languages and tools. Fewer still
	  have struggled through the process of:
	  • Defining, extending, or refining information metamodels (entity classes, attributes, and
	  relationships).
	  • Updating engineering methods to support the capture of such structured knowledge.
	  • Mapping free-form paragraph text within source documents to a structured information
	  metamodel, i.e., turning paragraph blobs into traceable objects/entities.
	  • Creating viewpoints (new diagram types) to visualize structured engineering knowledge.
	  • Developing software tools that guide the capture and use of structured engineering
	  knowledge.
	  • Figuring out how to use software tools to detect inconsistencies in system models and to
	  guide and confirm the resolution of such issues.
	  • Struggling to simplify the inherent complexity of modeling a system and the full range of
	  thinking that creates that system.
	  • Completing cycles of learning from missteps and failures in all the efforts noted above.
	  • Detecting patterns of thought that are the common building blocks of successful MBSE
	  practice.
	  This brief paper is an attempt to share one such pattern of thought that, in the opinion of the author,
	  cuts across nearly all the tasks that we perform when engineering solutions to any problem. That
	  pattern is MECE+ Thinking.
