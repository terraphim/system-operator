- [[Abstract]]
	- The role of Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) in business transformation varies in scope and impact. PLM initiatives range from Information System (IS) renewal to strategic business transformation, where often the capabilities to implement PLM successfully are unclear. This case study explains, through a case company example, the PLM concept journey from definition to implementation. It explains the variables influencing PLM transformation in an engineering technology company. This paper is based on an example carried out from 2011 to 2015 when the companyâ€™s strategy transformed it from an engineering company to a product and service company. The outcome show how a strategy-driven PLM transformation impacts a company at many levels, and also why the first PLM initiative had limited success due to focusing on IS driven process harmonisation. The case study also highlights the importance of the knowledge of the products, services and enterprise architecture, but also business models. The conclusions show PLM being at the core of business transformation, a cross-functional activity impacting products, services and customers.
