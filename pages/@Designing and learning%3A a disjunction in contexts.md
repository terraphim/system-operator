- [[Abstract]]
	- Two ideologies about engineering, one claimed the habit of engineering design practitioners, the other that of engineering educators, are advanced. The two are incompatible. The disjunction is elaborated in terms of two distinct postulates and their consequences. A remedy for educators is recommended and the experiences of the author in attempting to change the context of learning to better accord with engineering practice are described.
