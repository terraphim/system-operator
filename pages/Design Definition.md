type:: [[Business function]]
source:: [[@Digital Systems Engineering Process Model Version: 1.0]]
documentation:: As stated in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, [6.4.5.1] The purpose of the Design Definition process is to provide sufficient detailed data and information about the system and its elements to enable the implementation consistent with architectural entities as defined in models and views of the system architecture.  See detailed description in the INCOSE Handbook v.4, page 70.
inputs:: [[Life cycle concepts]], [[System function definition]], [[System requirements]], [[System functional interface identification]], [[System architecture description]], [[System architecture rationale]], [[Preliminary interface definition]], [[Preliminary TPM needs]], [[Preliminary TPM data]], [[Architecture traceability]], [[Interface definition update identification]], [[Implementation traceability]], [[Life cycle constraints]]
outputs:: [[Design definition strategy]], [[System design description]], [[System design rationale]], [[Interface definition]], [[TPM needs]], [[TPM data]], [[Design traceability]], [[System element description]], [[Design definition record]]
activities:: [[Prepare for design definition]], [[Establish design characteristics and design enablers related to each system element]], [[Assess alternatives for obtaining system elements]], [[Manage the design]]
