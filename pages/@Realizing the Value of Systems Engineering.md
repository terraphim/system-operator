- [[Abstract]]
	- Lessons learnt / observations from the implementation of Systems Engineering into organizations and development of product are presented, which show Systems Engineering to be a valuable and insightful approach to the practice of Engineering. The value comes from the Systems Engineering focus on seeing the whole, complete requirements, top down architecture, and enabling understanding / recognition of issues. The Systems Engineering approach improves the probability of success in complicated and complex situations. The approach is generic, and is able to provide ubiquitous value across a range of domains. Examples of its application are given from range of aerospace; land (products and infrastructure) and sea demonstrate how this value can be achieved. However application of Systems Engineering is not universally common, and there are a great many difficulties implementing it into an organization. Some of the problems experienced in trying to implement Systems Engineering are shared, and advice offered to Systems Advocates in a range of domains trying to implement Systems Engineering. Further, there are issues that INCOSE must address to help it achieve its vision to be “the world's authority on Systems Engineering”, and for the successful spread of Systems Engineering practice.
