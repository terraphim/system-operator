- [[Abstract]]
	- Decision-making is one of four fundamental human thinking (aka analysis) processes. Decisions comprise the essential thinking content, the integrative mechanism of any design process, and as such effect the transformation of a problem definition into a solution.
	  The author’s 35 years of experience in teaching and facilitating decision-making has led to the
	  conclusion that there is a pattern of decisions behind every strategy, solution design or life. A wide variety of decision patterns have been created and refined through use in 150+ projects across 40+ organizations. Multiple generations of software tools have been created or adapted to deliver decision
	  patterns to project teams.
	  This paper summarizes the conceptual basis for decision patterns and how they were “discovered”, defines a decision-centric information model of the engineering process, explains key principles behind how decision patterns create value, shares how a pattern-based decision model fits into a broader engineering process and identifies a range of use cases in which decision patterns have been employed.
	  Decision patterns examples will be shared to help the reader map this engineering construct to their experience. A more thorough coverage of the techniques, benefits and challenges of using decision patterns will be the subject of a follow-on article.
