- [[Abstract]]
	- This article reviews the structural characteristics of work organizations that are likely to increase collaboration problems and tests the relationships between collaboration structure and problems using data from a survey of scientists in four fields (experimental biology, mathematics, physics, and sociology). Two groups of problems are identified: problems of coordination and misunderstandings and problems of cultural differences and information security. Greater coordination problems are associated with size, distance, interdependence, and scientific competition. Problems of culture and security are associated with size, distance, scientific competition, and commercialization. Email use is associated with reporting fewer coordination problems, but not fewer problems of culture and security, while neither phone use nor face-to-face meetings significantly reduces problems. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of these findings for designers of collaboration technologies and researchers involved in scientific collaborations.
