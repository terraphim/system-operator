- [[Abstract]]
	- Recent trends in targeted cyber-attacks has increased the interest of research in the field of cyber security. Such attacks have massive disruptive effects on organizations, enterprises and governments. Cyber kill chain is a model to describe cyber-attacks so as to develop incident response and analysis capabilities. Cyber kill chain in simple terms is an attack chain, the path that an intruder takes to penetrate information systems over time to execute an attack on the target. This paper broadly categories the methodologies, techniques and tools involved in cyber-attacks. This paper intends to help a cyber security researcher to realize the options available to an attacker at every stage of a cyber-attack.
