- [[Abstract]]
	- The Graduate Reference Curriculum for Systems Engineering (GRCSE™) is a product of the Body of Knowledge and Curriculum to Advance Systems Engineering (BKCASE™) project. The original BKCASE project was led by Stevens Institute of Technology and the Naval Postgraduate School.
	  This project created two products: GRCSE and the Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge (SEBoK) (BKCASE Editorial Board, 2015). SEBoK is a guide that provides an overview of key systems engineering (SE) knowledge areas and topics, and directs users to references from the SE literature. Version 1.0 of SEBoK was released in September 2012 and a number of updates have been made since. See www.SEBoKwiki.org for details of the latest version. GRCSE make significant use of SEBoK as a reference for the SE content element of its curriculum recommendations.
