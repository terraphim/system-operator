documentation:: An account prepared for interested parties in order to communicate the status, results, and outcomes of the risk management activities. The risks are documented and communicated along with rationale, assumptions, treatment plans, and current status. For selected risks, an action plan is produced to direct the project team to update the project plan and properly respond to the risks. If appropriate, change requests are generated to mitigate technical risk. Risk profiles and/or risk matrices summarize the risks and contain the findings of the risk management process.
