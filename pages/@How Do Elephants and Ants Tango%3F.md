- [[Abstract]]
	- The PLM journey at Outotec covers Plant, Equipment and Service businesses. It started in 2011 in conjunction with a global processes and IT systems harmonization program. This case study focuses on the years 2016–2018 and adjusting the concept—the so-called “making elephants and ants tango” or “one size doesn’t fit all”—phase of the PLM journey. It outlines PLM activities for both Equipment Products and Plants, then describes some lessons learned. Finally, next steps are discussed.
