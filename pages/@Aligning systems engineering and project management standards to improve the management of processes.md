- [[Abstract]]
	- For achieving the success of the project, relying on the systems engineering processes or project management processes is not sufficient and projects often fail due to deficient systems engineering practices or project management practices, or, at least, due to a lack of a coherency/consistency between the two aspects. So it is necessary to correctly implement systems engineering and project management processes during the whole project. This issue of SE and PM integration lies at the very heart of current research concerns. It is at the core of economic and industrial concerns. The goal of this paper is to analyze and compare the five important systems engineering standards (ANSI/EIA 632, ISO/IEC 15288, IEEE 1220, INCOSE Handbook and SEBoK) and the two project management standards (PMBoK and ISO 21500) to evaluate the consistency and inconsistency in order to facilitate the management of the projects and improve their possibility of success.
