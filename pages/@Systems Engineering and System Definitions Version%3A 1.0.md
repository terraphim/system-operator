- [[Abstract]]
	- The Fellows Initiative on System and Systems Engineering Definitions was established in 2016, to:
	  1. review current INCOSE definitions of SYSTEM and SYSTEMS ENGINEERING; and
	  2. recommend any changes necessary to align the definitions to current practice and to the aspirations of INCOSE’s 2025 Vision.
	  This document presents the final proposals from the initiative. It takes into account the extensive comments received during the review of the previous draft in September 2018. The review was open to all INCOSE members, and attracted over 350 individual comments and suggestions.
	  The three key recommendations – for definitions of systems engineering, engineered system, and a general definition of system - are presented below, with a very brief contextual explanation. After the table of contents, the main body of this document provides more explanation of these definitions, and also defines other specific system types and categories that are important for the systems engineering community.
