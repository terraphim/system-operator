- [[Abstract]]
	- Design methodology has always seemed to have a problematic relationship with science. The “design methods movement” started out with intentions of making design more “scientific”, but the more mature field of design methodology has resulted in clarifying the differences between design and science. This paper reviews the relatively short history of design methodology and its relationship with science, maps out some of the major themes that have sustained it, and tries to establish some agreed understanding for the concepts of scientific design, design science and the science of design.
