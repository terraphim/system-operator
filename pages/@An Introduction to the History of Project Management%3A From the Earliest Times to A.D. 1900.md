- [[Abstract]]
	- Project management applies knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to project activities in order to achieve defined requirements. It is the very deliberate orchestration of the areas of expertise to complete a specific project. Investigating the history of project management is to reach a comprehensive view of the historical development of the areas of expertise and their application to project activities. This research identifies six research topics, based on the areas of project management expertise, to guide data collection and the research process. In the contribution to architecture, the research regards "building construction and engineering structures" as the application area of project management.--P [4] de la couv
