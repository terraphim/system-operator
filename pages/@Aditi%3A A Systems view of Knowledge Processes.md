- [[Abstract]]
	- Knowledge is central to systems engineering. Systems engineering activities generate, evolve and utilize knowledge. The typical processes adopted as part of this endeavor are: a) Transforming observations into models, b) Formulating multiple-models to capture different aspects, c) Developing a holistic understanding using these models, d) Enhancing the understanding by fostering social agreement between different observers, e) Identifying the engineering goals based on this understanding, f) Designing the intervention by achieving specific engineering goals, and g) Refining and evolving the engineered outcomes. Understanding these processes and their outcomes would aid in developing better foundations for the systems engineering practice. In this paper, the “Aditi” framework is proposed as a tool that practitioners can utilize to ascertain the theories and laws applicable to the various knowledge processes in systems engineering. The framework provides a simple approach to integrate the different knowledge processes by means of a collection of reinforcing loops.
