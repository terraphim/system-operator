source:: [[@ArchiMate 3.2 Specification]]
definition:: A business object represents a concept used within a particular business domain.
documentation:: Business object typically models an object type (cf.Â a UML class) of which multiple instances may exist in operations. Only occasionally, business objects represent actual instances of information produced and consumed by behavior elements such as business processes. This is in particular the case for singleton types; i.e., types that have only one instance.
