- [[Abstract]]
	- This Guide has been prepared and produced by the Requirements Working Group (RWG) of the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE). The original document coalesced inputs from numerous INCOSE contributors, edited by Jeremy Dick, published in draft form in December 2009 for internal INCOSE review, and later published as an INCOSE Technical Product in July 2015. Subsequently, the document has been revised extensively following reviews by the RWG members. The latest revision represents a further evolution of the concepts communicated within the Guide based on comments and inputs received from members of the RWG and larger body of INCOSE members. This latest revision also brings the Guide in harmony with the latest versions of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, the INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook version 5, and the other major RWG products: the Needs and Requirements Manual (NRM), the Guide to Needs and Requirements (GtNR), and the Guide to Verification and Validation (GtVV).
