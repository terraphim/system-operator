- [[Abstract]]
	- This paper demonstrates a method to structure a complex system development organization based on both the product architecture and the technical communication exchange. This is accomplished using two DSM data sets â€“ one documenting the component interfaces and another capturing the level of cross- functional communication. The clustering analysis utilizes a combined DSM that makes explicit any mismatches between the product and organization architectures and simultaneously clusters interactions in both dimensions.
