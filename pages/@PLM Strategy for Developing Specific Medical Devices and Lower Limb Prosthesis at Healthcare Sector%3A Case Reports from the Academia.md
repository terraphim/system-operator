- [[Abstract]]
	- The study aims to present advances made by the academia in terms of multidisciplinary work among groups formed by industrial designers, industrial engineers, physiotherapists, and physicians, related to a University Hospital in a local environment in order to consolidate a collaborative strategy that allows the development of specific medical devices. Methodology A product portfolio consolidated by surgical devices and lower limb prostheses was the outcome of undergraduate projects, master and medical-surgical specialization projects working together. The baseline of surgical devices contains virtual pre-planning, biomodels, surgical guides, and implants according to requirements from different anatomical areas, predominantly skull and knee treatments. The baseline of lower limb prostheses presents cases developed and tested with users who had transtibial or transfemoral unilateral amputation. Results As the number of actors who shared data and limited resources increased, a gradual implementation of PLM strategy was established by building collaborative databases based on an established conceptual framework proposed by previous tool selection, so that the roles for project execution were defined in terms of access according to the role. To achieve comprehension among participants, a visualization model was adapted to involve workflows, roles, capabilities, and resources. Several data were collected from study cases to be stored and retrieved for further development according to stage development, understanding time and resources implemented to respond to a short period request when schedule uncertainties demand those requirements. Regardless of those results, the further project needs biocompatible materials as well as machines capable of transforming this raw material in order to achieve high-quality standards.
