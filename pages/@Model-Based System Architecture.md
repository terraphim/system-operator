- [[Abstract]]
	- MODEL-BASED SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AN UP-TO-DATE EXPLORATION OF THE NEWEST STANDARDS AND BEST PRACTICES IN SYSTEM ARCHITECTING In the newly revised Second Edition of Model-Based System Architecture, a team of expert engineers deliver a detailed and authoritative review of the practice of system architecture in organizations that use models to support the systems engineering process. In the book, readers will find introductions to the fundamentals of architecting systems and using models to assist the architecting process. The latest edition offers refreshed content based on ISO 15288:2015 and a renewed focus on the role of the system architect. New chapters on systems-of-systems, and cyber-physical systems, and system architect tools offer guidance to practicing professionals on how to apply the presented concepts in the real-world. In addition to the latest definitions of the architecture governance and evaluation processes described in ISO 42020 and 42030, the book provides: A thorough introduction to the value of systems architecting, definitions of system architecture, and model-based system architecture Comprehensive explorations of model governance, architecture descriptions, patterns, and principles, and the roles of typical architecture stakeholders Practical discussions of Agile approaches to systems architecture, the FAS Method, and architecture frameworks In-depth examinations of systems architecting work and necessary soft skills for systems architects Modeling of system architectures with SysML including a brief overview of SysML v1 and an outlook to SysML v2 Perfect for system architects and system engineers, Model-Based System Architecture will also earn a place in the libraries of students and researchers studying functional architectures.
