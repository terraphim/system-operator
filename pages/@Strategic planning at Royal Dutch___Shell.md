- [[Abstract]]
	- In the early 1980s, the Royal Dutch/Shell Group conducted a comprehensive review of its approach to strategic planning throughout the organization. This was done at two levels. First, the views of Shell managers and planners were collected and analysed. Second, the state of the art outside the company was studied for its relevance to Shell. The conclusions reached have been the basis for the Shell approach to strategic planning since then. This paper offers a detailed look at the principles that have been guiding strategic management in Shell. It describes the group-wide planning system designed at that time and the new orientation aimed for in its planning methodologies.
	  Although Shell is by no means a typical company, it can be viewed as an interesting limit case in the global management of uncertainty and complexity. Few industries have encountered in their raw materials the volatility exhibited by oil prices, nor do few entail lead times as long or assets as specialized as those in the oil and gas industry. Adding to this, the political complexities inherent in dealing with governments, plus the unusual complexity of Shell's organizational design, provides for a fascinating study and challenge in the management of change. The paper concludes with a commentary on the distinctive features of the Shell approach.
