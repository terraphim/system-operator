- [[Abstract]]
	- Widespread digitization is creating new sources of data that record sequences of actions and events. These action sequences can be used to trace coherent streams of activity in social, economic and business processes. These sources of data, along with new computational methods, create an opportunity to visualize, analyze and compare patterns of actions as a unit of analysis. This paper discusses the connections of this idea to a variety of related fields and maps out some first steps of an action-centric agenda for research.
