- [[Abstract]]
	- This paper introduces “PROMONT”, a project management ontology. PROMONT models project management specifications from a number of sources, most notably the upcoming DIN 69901 model for the exchange of project data. As a reference ontology it helps to build a common understanding of project related terms and methods thus facilitating the management of projects conducted in dynamic virtual environments. It is especially well suited for cross-enterprise project related business processes such as integration management, communication and controlling. A distributed project scenario is used to illustrate how a project plan is broken down for individual partners, and how activities are coordinated in a heterogeneous group.
