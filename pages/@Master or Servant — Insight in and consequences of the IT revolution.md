- [[Abstract]]
	- On 19 Nov 2020 I gave this talk at IASA's BIL-T Conference. It is an extremely condensed (40 min talk, 13 min Q&A) analysis of what the digital revolution is doing to us, humans, organisations, and societies, based on an analysis of certain essentials of IT and of human psychology and intelligence and of our societies.
	  
	  Aspects addressed are:
	  - Digital IT is nothing more than machine logic. The information revolution is the result of bringing unprecedented amounts of logical behaviour into the world;
	  - Logic has some special characteristics, e.g. it is free from uncertainty, and free space and time, but it is also both 'rigid' and  'brittle';
	  - The mere volume of logic is also having specific effects, such as that it is the root cause for it becoming harder and harder to change complex IT landscapes (because of the brittleness amongst other things). (Flexible) humans and organisations react to this in certain ways (e.g. by organisational changes such as Agile and DevOps);
	  - The behaviour of IT extends the behaviour of us as a species and it also enables an unprecedented reach of group communication. we are becoming 'mental cyborgs';
	  - Our psychology and (limited) intelligence is not optimised for this state of affairs, as a result, important aspects of what makes a society are crumbling;
	  -  Social media's algorithms inherently destabilise society because they are a form of positive feedback (in engineering, negative feedback creates stability)
	  - The state of affairs divides us into masters (those who decide on the algorithms and their use) and servants (those that undergo their effects). One can be both at the same time;
	  - This development is extremely damaging for societies and we need to do something;
	  - One thing we should do is for workers in IT to pledge an oath like the Hippocratic oath that medical doctors take
	  - Another thing is that we need to create regulation that protects societies and individuals against the onslaught of the algorithms.
	  
	  Note: I must apologise for the many linguistic (pronunciation, grammar) errors during my presentation. It was unscripted and I did not have the time to thoroughly practice and that made it a lot poorer than it could have been. The advantage is that it is more lively and entertaining  than a scripted narrative.
	  
	  PS. Thanks IASA for sharing the raw footage of the slides and the audio. For the geeks: I used the audio of the IASA video and made it lip sync with my own footage of me speaking arranged in the lower right corner. That was an interesting challenge given for instance the 210ms latency between me speaking on one end and it arriving at IASA (especially at the end when we were in discussion, there is some trickery going on there). And somehow, probably dropped frames here or there, the footages weren't exactly aligned so I had to fix that as well.
