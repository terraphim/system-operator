- [[Abstract]]
	- Using virtual models instead of physical models can help industries reduce the time and cost of developments, despite the time consuming process of building virtual models. Therefore, reusing previously built virtual models instead of starting from scratch can eliminate a large amount of work from users. Is having a virtual model enough to reuse it in another study or task? In most cases, not. Information about the history of that model makes it clear for the users to decide if they can reuse this model or to what extent the model needs to be modified. A provenance management system (PMS) has been designed to manage provenance information, and it has been used with product lifecycle management system (PLM) and computer-aided technologies (CAx) to save and present historical information about a virtual model. This case study presents a sequence-based framework of the CAx-PLM-PMS chain and two application case studies considering the implementation of this framework.
