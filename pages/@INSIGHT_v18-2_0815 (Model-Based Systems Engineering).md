	- The first user segment will be [[Lens builder]]. They are expert users who can analyze the texts and build formal models (knowledge graph templates for specific roles) from them that others can use to get insights and adapt their search relevance. I will be lens builder for MBSE set of roles
	- ## Author's specific terms for activities
		- ((64af9595-87ca-4f8b-acf2-27993739854a))
			- features:: [[Logseq highlights import]], [[Terms candidates extraction]], [[Term type proposition]], [[4D-activity model generation and basic checks]], [[Terms validation]]
			- [[Modeling trends]], [[Systems engineering]]
			- Term-type proposition using the decision tree for the BFO 2.0 classifier (full wizard) or lightweight adjectives and plurals drop, like in this example "modeling trends" -> "trend."
			- What is an activity? -> "Exists," "Emerging."
			- Then, we check are the terms valid through basic checks - search for them, and what the usage is. Bing, for example:
			  collapsed:: true
				- A **modeling trend** is a general systematic linear or (most often) nonlinear component that changes over time and does not repeat. It is a pattern of gradual change in a condition, output, or process, or an average or general tendency of a series of data points to move in a certain direction over time.
				- Trend forecasting is a complicated but useful way to look at past sales or market growth, determine possible trends from that data and use the information to extrapolate what could happen in the future.
				- Maybe, put such generated answers in the definition property of the terms page.
			- Also, here "systems engineering" is a label for "companies that use SE," aka "industry," but I have no idea how we can detect such inaccurate usage of terms, so we're skipping it for now.
