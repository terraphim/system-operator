- [[Abstract]]
	- A new, emerging standard on architecture evaluation is under development to be published as ISO/IEC 42030. This paper provides an overview of the key concepts in this standard and the rationale for these ideas. The standard defines key elements used in an evaluation: evaluation objectives, criteria, and approach; value assessment objectives, criteria, and methods; and architecture analysis objectives, criteria, and methods. It is expected that these evaluation elements will be used when evaluating architectures and their implementation. This standard can be used as a foundation for organizational training and guidebooks on architecture evaluation methodologies and for related techniques and tools. It can also be used as a basis for implementation of architecture processes.
