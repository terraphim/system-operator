- [[Abstract]]
	- Causal decision theory adopts principles of rational choice thatattend to an act’s consequences. It maintains that an account ofrational choice must use causality to identify the considerations thatmake a choice rational., Given a set of options constituting a decision problem, decisiontheory recommends an option that maximizes utility, that is, an optionwhose utility equals or exceeds the utility of every other option. Itevaluates an option’s utility by calculating the option’sexpected utility. It uses probabilities and utilities of anoption’s possible outcomes to define an option’s expectedutility. The probabilities depend on the option. Causal decisiontheory takes the dependence to be causal rather than merelyevidential., This essay explains causal decision theory, reviews its history,describes current research in causal decision theory, and surveys thetheory’s philosophical foundations. The literature on causaldecision theory is vast, and this essay covers only a portion ofit.
