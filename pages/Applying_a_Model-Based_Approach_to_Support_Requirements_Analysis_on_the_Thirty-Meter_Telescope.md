- This article describes how a model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approach was used to support requirements analysis, system design, and early verification for critical subsystems of the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) [8]. The MBSE approach applied the Executable Systems Engineering Method (ESEM) [4] [5] and the Open-source Engineering Environment (OpenMBEE) [7] to specify, analyze, and verify requirements of TMT’s Alignment and Phasing System (APS) and the Narrow Field Infrared Adaptive Optics System (NFIRAOS). The value proposition for applying this MBSE approach was to establish precise requirements and fine-grained traceability to system designs, and to verify key requirements using executable SysML [6] models beginning early in development.

  The TMT (Figure 1) is a next-generation ground-based extremely large telescope designed to answer key science questions regarding the nature and composition of the Universe. At its core is a wide-field, altitude-azimuth Ritchey-Chrétien design with a 492 segment, 30-meter diameter primary mirror (M1), a fully active secondary mirror, and an articulated tertiary mirror. Each segment’s optical performance is sensitive to three rigid body degrees of freedom: piston, tip, and tilt. To obtain optimal image quality, the segmented M1 must perform like a single monolithic mirror, achieved through a multitude of controls working to co-align, co-focus, and co-phase its segments. The APS (Figure 2) is responsible for the overall pre-adaptive optics wavefront quality, using starlight to measure wavefront errors and align the TMT optics. Adaptive optics systems like the NFIRAOS (Figure 2) are designed to sense real-time atmospheric turbulence and correct the telescope’s optical beam to remove its effect, enabling diffraction-limited imaging on the ground. In LGS MCAO and NGSAO modes, this is achieved through the use of wavefront sensors to detect laser and natural guide stars and deformable mirrors to direct the corrected wavefront to science instruments. These opto-mechanical designs and complex controls are constrained by several requirements that must be satisfied.
