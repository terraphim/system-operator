- [[Abstract]]
	- Information and communication technology (ICT) systems underpin many of today’s societal functions and economic development. Consequently, protecting a nation’s ICT infrastructure from deliberate cyber attacks and unintentional disruptions is of paramount importance. Collaboration among all parties across all domains of cyberspace is the key to effective and coordinated effort to cope with cyber threats. This is particularly the case as cyber threats become increasingly sophisticated and distributed. In this paper, we introduce the foundational building blocks to realize an efficient incident response cycle on a national level, and propose the design of a conceptual framework – the Cyber Attack Information System (CAIS) – for establishing national cyber situational awareness.
