- [[Abstract]]
	- As an alternative to the prevalent "requirements-first" approach this paper introduces a value-seeking approach to the engineering of complex, adaptive systems. The value-seeking approach exercises three distinct viewpoints: a focus on the system to be created, a higher focus on system purpose, and an even higher focus on system value. Within this context a goal-seeking system archetype is proposed as an appropriate implementation method that converges on acceptable perceived value by overcoming inexplicability, encouraging dialog and enabling engineering.
