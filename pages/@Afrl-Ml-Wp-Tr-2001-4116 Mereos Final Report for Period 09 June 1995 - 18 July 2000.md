- [[Abstract]]
	- The mereos program is an Enabling Technology Developments and Demonstrations project of the Agile Manufacturing Pilot Program funded by the United States Air Force Research Laboratory, Materials & Manufacturing Directorate, Manufacturing Technology Division under contract F33615-95-C-5519.
	  Mereos is one element of the Platform for Automated  Construction of Intelligent Systems project. The two primary mereos program objectives were first, to identify the root causes of the multiple bom reconciliation problem and define the requirements for a solution, and second, to
	  prove, via demonstration, the feasibility of developing a system to implement that solution.
	  The technical aim of the pacis project is to produce a next-generation database programming system that provides the tools required to develop, deploy and sustain large-scale manufacturing enterprise decision automation systems. The strategic aim of the project is to enhance the value of solutions enterprises deliver to their stakeholders by bringing automation to bear on enterprise integration and on critical processes in their value streams—specifically, those processes requiring extensive experience and cognitive skills to execute or govern—and, accordingly, those which have heretofore been intractable to any but the most superficial automation.
