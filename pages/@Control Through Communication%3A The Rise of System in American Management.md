- [[Abstract]]
	- Caught in the midst of an information revolution, today's business managers and scholars are trying to assess the likely effects of the sweeping changes now taking place in technolocy and in organization. In Control through Communication JoAnne Yates looks back to the last major shift in the use of communication and information-and writes the first full and detailed account of the process by which modern managerical systems came to be created within the American business system. Focusing on the evolution of corporate communication as an integrated whole, Yates examines its functions, technologies, and genres in case studies of the Illinois Central Railroad, Scovill Manufacturing Company, and E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company.
