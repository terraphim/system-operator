- [[Abstract]]
	- Metadata, the information we create, store, and share to describe things, allows us to interact with these things to obtain the knowledge we need. This primer by Jenn Riley of McGill University Library offers a comprehensive overview of metadata, covering topics such as metadata types, standardization, and use in the cultural heritage sector and in the broader world. The Primer is accompanied by plentiful examples of metadata at work.
