- [[Abstract]]
	- This paper aims to examine and document the current state of practice of model-based systems engineering (MBSE), and how organizations look toward the future. The paper is based on a survey of how MBSE has been applied and factors that influenced the perceived benefits and results. The survey was designed to evaluate the maturity and status of the implementation of MBSE (also called model-centric systems engineering), within industry, academia, and governments. The approach to the survey development is described along with the survey results. The study indicates that one of the main hurdles to introducing a model-based approach is the lack of clear and adopted organizational structures and an understanding of required conditions and needs at a management level. The survey also indicates that 50â€“75% of the respondents noted some improvement or a significant improvement across almost all systems engineering tasks.
