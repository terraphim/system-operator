- [[Abstract]]
	- Presented by: David Long, President of Vitech, former President of INCOSE
	  Presented remotely to attendees of the 2015 Australian Systems Engineering Workshop
	  Abstract:
	  This presentation takes the audience through the life cycle of model based systems engineering and leaves us with a compelling vision of the near future.  It gives concrete steps of how to get there, where SE has matured as a discipline.  MBSE is then an essential tool of the trade, and the focus for Systems Engineers is the Systems Engineering discipline, more engaged and more effective than ever before.
