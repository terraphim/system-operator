- [[Abstract]]
	- This article compares older traditional methods of management in the construction industry
	  with newer, more bureaucratic methods. The theme of the article is that bureaucratic management
	  techniques in construction has an ineffective impact on the construction work. The article
	  outlines the construction work process and traditional styles of construction management. It
	  then examines how the new techniques o f computer programming and large staffing have resulted
	  in inefficiencies and irrationalities in attempts to control the construction work process.
	  In the discussion portion of the article the data are related to the notion that human interrelationships
	  are the primary resources in any work organization and, this being especially true
	  for the construction industry, reliance on authoritarian, mechanistic techniques in management
	  results in failure in the attempts o f management to control the work process.
	  The author o f the article is a construction engineer with twenty-five years experience in the
	  construction industry. He compares his previous experiences as a project manager and project
	  engineer with methods on his present project, a 200 million dollar research and engineering tenter
	  for one of the major industrial corporations in the United States. The author is currently the
	  chief engineer on his construction project.
