- [[Abstract]]
	- This paper was written from the perspective that requirements, along with all work products, models, designs, documents, diagrams, drawings, etc.) generated during the performance of System Engineering (SE) lifecycle process activities are represented by underlying data and information that must be linked together and integrated into a common, integrated dataset. Using this perspective, the common, integrated dataset can be viewed as the foundation of Systems Engineering. The authors feel this data-centric perspective of SE provides a better lens through which to acquire a complete understanding of the SE lifecycle process activities and resulting work products and underlying data and information needed to manage the development of increasingly complex systems of the future. This perspective aids in acquiring a practical understanding of the SE lifecycle processes from the perspective of not only models, but all work products that are generated from activities conducted during each of the SE lifecycle processes and the underlying data and information used to represent these work products. Expanding on the concept of SE from a data-centric perspective, the goal of this paper is to present a broader data-centric perspective of SE that meets that will aid readers in successfully meeting the challenges associated with today's ever increasingly complex systems, meeting the intent of the MBSE Initiative, and helping organizations move toward INCOSE's Vision 2025.
