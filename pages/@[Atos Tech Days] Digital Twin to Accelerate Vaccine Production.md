- [[Abstract]]
	- Atos and Siemens are working together with the pharmaceutical industry to improve production with an innovative solution based on a digital replica of the pharma production process. This “Process Digital Twin” for pharma manufacturing – powered by IoT, AI and Advanced Analytics – is designed to provide improved efficiency and flexibility in the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products. This potentially disruptive solution opens up new opportunities, such as a sustainable process development – reducing overall experimentation time and waste, ensuring constant quality and moving to new “quality by design” models to get the product right the first time.
	  The nature of Atos and Siemens’ pre-integrated Digital Twin solution allows it to be deployed to production processes of any scale or complexity. By adjusting the technological building blocks Atos and Siemens can replicate Digital Twin use case to every new client – within pharmaceutical, chemical, process manufacturing industries and other markets – more efficiently.
