	  Abstract: Abstract:  Clients and Customers often believe they know the solution they prefer but may not understand the problem they need solved. So their requirements may be non-existent, incomplete, or incorrect. Requirements "elicitation" may be inadequate to actually realize a correct and complete set of requirements. This presentation explains how to develop requirements when there aren't any or they are not complete, consistent or correct. Checklists for engaging clients and customers are included.
