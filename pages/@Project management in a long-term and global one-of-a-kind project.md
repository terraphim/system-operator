- [[Abstract]]
	- This paper discusses the project management issues in global one-of-a-kind-projects with several years of duration along with considerable design and engineering work. The main functions related to the coordination of such projects are related to communication, product control and management itself. Exploitation of modern communication technologies provides the project with the means to tackle collaboration barriers stemming from geographically distant partners. Yet, it is argued that electronic networking must be complemented with carefully phased face-to-face milestone meetings. Product control aspect breaks down into design change, engineering work and information flow control, that is configuration management. In this way the product and its compliance with customer needs is secured with overall cost efficiency during the product's whole life cycle. Apart from the traditional planning, scheduling and control functions, along with the ultimate authorization, the project management issues also cover the integrative role and, above all, the reconnaissance procedures to detect from past and present progress the prominent near-future pitfalls. Based on empirical observations of global one-of-a-kind projects the paper argues that strict management protocols combined with efficient communication infrastructure provide the best means to ensure that the project goals are met under the given budget, schedule and quality requirements.
