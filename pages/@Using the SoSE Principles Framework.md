- [[Abstract]]
	- This paper is concerned with the principles for successful System of Systems Engineering practice and their use. The paper opens with a description of the need for System-of-Systems Engineering (SoSE) within the Australian Defense context and the research underway to support its introduction. An overview of previous work by the authors follows describing the three-layer framework used to hold the SoSE principles (Pratt & Cook, 2017) to provide context. This framework comprises an articulation of the worldview which makes SoSE meaningful, the concepts that drive SoSE methodology design and use (descriptive heuristics), and implementation principles (prescriptive heuristics). The paper discusses the need for substantiation of these principles and the framework, the methods by which this being conducted and some the initial work assessing coverage and applicability. Finally, the paper provides suggestions for how this framework and associated principles can be employed for its stated purpose (utility), with specific regards for different stakeholders and their varied roles and responsibilities.
