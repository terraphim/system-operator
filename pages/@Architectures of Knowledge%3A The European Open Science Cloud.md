	- Abstract
	              
	                In November 2018, the European Commission launched the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) in Vienna. The EOSC envisions establishing a European data infrastructure, integrating high-capacity cloud solutions, eventually widening the scope of these services to include the public sector and the industry. Understanding the EOSC structure is a first step in recognizing the opportunities offered by the newly launched EOSC. This article offers some reflections for a better understanding of the realization of the EOSC at the present stage, including currently ongoing developments.
