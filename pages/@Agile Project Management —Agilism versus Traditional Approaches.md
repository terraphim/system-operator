- [[Abstract]]
	- For decades now, corporations have been changing from a hierarchical approach to project management to being more collaborative as knowledge work has grown in importance. In the center of increased globalization is the need for project managers to have flexibility in a project system in order to be able to adjust constantly to emerging challenges and opportunities.The need to distribute responsibility and initiative in support of adaptation to change is familiar territory to “agile” approaches to projects. In this paper, Agile Project Management will be examined from its historical practices and applicability of this style of project management to more traditional approaches to project management. Agile Project Management has proven to be a useful tool for today's knowledge worker and the project managers in the new economy which is characterized by more complex and uncertain project situations. This paper presents fundamental information about the agile methodology to encourage its implementation by professionals.
