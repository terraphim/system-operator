- [[Abstract]]
	- I love entrepreneurs—not because they are the smartest people I have ever met, though this is often the case, but because (and I hate this overused word, but here it is) they have passion. They have arrived at an idea that they believe brings value to the world. Did I say “believe?” I meant know. They know their idea will bring value to the world, they intend to make it real, and they intend to do it themselves, proving any naysayers wrong. They are subject-matter experts (sometimes unacknowledged) and it is from this reservoir of expertise that their idea arises. They see a better or different way to do something, and they know they can make it happen. My experience is that the idea is their primary driver, not making money. The entrepreneur is motivated by the act of creation.
