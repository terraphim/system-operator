- [[Abstract]]
	- This paper was written from the perspective that requirements, along with all work products (models, designs, documents, diagrams, drawings, etc.) generated during the performance of System Engineering (SE) lifecycle process activities are represented by underlying data and information that must be integrated into a common, integrated dataset. From this data-centric perspective, the common, integrated dataset can be viewed as the foundation of Systems Engineering. Based on this perspective, this paper discusses what it means to practice SE from a data-centric perspective and provides the reader guidance that can be used to understand and successfully create and manage an integrated dataset within their organization.
