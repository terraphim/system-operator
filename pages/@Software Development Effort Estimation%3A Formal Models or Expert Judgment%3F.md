- [[Abstract]]
	- Which is better for estimating software project resources: formal models, as instantiated in estimation tools, or expert judgment? Two luminaries, debate this question in this paper. For this debate, they're taking opposite sides and trying to help software project managers figure out when, and under what conditions, each method would be best.
