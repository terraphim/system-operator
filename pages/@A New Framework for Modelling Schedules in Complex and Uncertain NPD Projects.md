- [[Abstract]]
	- Producing reliable schedules for new product development (NPD) projects can be difficult. The uncertainty involved in NPD and the complex relationships between project tasks often leads to task repetition. This results in project schedules that are not linear and cannot be predicted using traditional methods. This case introduces a new modelling approach that aims to provide a more accurate and process specific representation of NPD project schedules. It was developed in a large multi-national component company and addresses the challenges they face producing accurate schedules for their NPD projects. The new approach uses a set of process specific variables rather than the subjective iteration probabilities used by earlier approaches. This results in more reliable project schedules accounting for specific project variations.
