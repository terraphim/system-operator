- [[Abstract]]
	- Storytelling is an important skill that can be a key enabler for systems engineering, providing value throughout the systems engineering process. In areas such as requirements, design and testing, storytelling can improve the ability to communicate across boundaries, providing improved context, understanding and empathy between project stakeholders. At the project level, storytelling is useful in enhancing communication and engagement, thereby helping to improve team performance. Finally, storytelling can help promote the profession of systems engineering, at the organizational level and beyond, helping to instill pride in our profession, as well as sharing culture and values.
