- [[Abstract]]
	- PLM is the most desirable tool in the manufacturing sector these days. The offerings of PLM are still improving day by day in order to improve the cost, time, and quality of products. This case study discusses PLM benefits and individuals’ perception of the existing benefits. Based on a survey conducted among Indian manufacturing firms, PLM benefits are ranked using t-test. This case study provides a general view of an individual’s understanding and adaptability for PLM. On assessing the present status of PLM among users, top management may guide their subordinates to better understand PLM and improve the contribution of PLM for digitisation.
