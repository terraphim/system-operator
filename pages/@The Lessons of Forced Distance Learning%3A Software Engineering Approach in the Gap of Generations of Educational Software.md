- [[Abstract]]
	- Quite recently, considerable attention has been paid to distance learning due to mass schools and universities closing because of coronavirus disease. This fact brought to light not only strengths but also weaknesses of existing educational software and use cases. This paper is motivated by the questions which are rinsed by thoroughly adopted educational software and the deep gap between educational methodologies and up-to-date distributed information infrastructure capabilities. The lack of an engineering approach in the deployment of distance learning tools leads to both technological and methodological problems. We present exploratory analysis of data gathered from authority web sources. The significant ideological differences between educational software generations are discussed with special attention to non-cloud-based and cloud-based collaborative technologies and corresponding platforms. The authors conclude that the power of integration based on industry-wide interoperability standards is useful to solve current problems in distance education related to software.
