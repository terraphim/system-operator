- [[Abstract]]
	- This paper explores the relationship between process and tools for systems engineering. There is much interest now in process maturity, yet there are many cases of processes being developed and deployed with little effect on the bottom line. In fact, there are times when the overall health of the engineering organization is not improved with the use of standardized processes and tools. It is important to have a proper balance among process, methods, tools, and environment (PMTE) when performing systems engineering (SE) tasks. An improper balance leads to increased costs and lower quality, in addition to frustration for engineers and for management. The particular PMTE elements appropriate for a project should be defined and documented in an SE Development Environment (SEDE) Plan which can cover the gaps in a project SE Management Plan (SEMP). This paper proposes a paradigm for understanding the PMTE elements for systems engineering.
