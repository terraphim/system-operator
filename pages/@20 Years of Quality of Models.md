- [[Abstract]]
	- We are very pleased that our CAiSE’95 paper has been selected to be included in the Springer book that celebrates the 25th anniversary of the CAiSE conferences series. This paper entitled ‘Towards a Deeper Understanding of Quality in Requirements Engineering’ presented a development of work started some years earlier in the research group of Arne Sølvberg on the topic of quality of models. This topic has been of interest during the next 20 years by us and a number of other researchers both in the context of IS development and in other areas, and will in our view be a relevant topic for the foreseeable future.
