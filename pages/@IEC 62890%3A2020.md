- [[Abstract]]
	- IEC 62890:2020 establishes basic principles for Life-Cycle-Management of systems and components used for industrial-process measurement, control and automation. These principles are applicable to various industrial sectors. This standard provides definitions and reference models related to the life-cycle of a product type and the life time of a product instance, It defines a consistent set of generic reference models and terms. The key models defined are:
	  – Life-Cycle-Model;
	  – structure model;
	  – compatibility model.
	  This document also describes the application of these models for Life-Cycle-Management strategies. The content is used for technical aspects concerning the design, planning, development and maintenance of automation systems and components and the operation of the plant.
	  The definitions of generic models and terms regarding Life-Cycle-Management are indispensable for a common understanding and application by all partners in the value chain such as plant user, product and system producer, service provider, and component supplier.
	  The models and strategies described in this standard are also applicable for related management systems, i.e. MES and ERP
