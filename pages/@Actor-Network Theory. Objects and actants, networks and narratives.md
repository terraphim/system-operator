- [[Abstract]]
	- The chapter provides a concise introduction to Actor-network theory by revisiting some of the classical texts and asking how these spur new interesting questions on the role of science and technology in (international) politics. A must read for anyone interested in ANT and the dialogue between IR and STS.
