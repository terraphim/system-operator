- [[Abstract]]
	- The document is organized to address two main objectives. The first objective is to define the basic concepts behind measurement and measurement programs in such a way that they will be usable and readable, regardless of experience and background; 
	  these concepts are described in sections 2 and 3. The second objective is to prepare and use a measurement program by providing requisite background knowledge; 
	  sections 4 and 5 focus on this aim.
