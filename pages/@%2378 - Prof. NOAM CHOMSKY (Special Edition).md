	  In this special edition episode, we have a conversation with Prof. Noam Chomsky, the father of modern linguistics and the most important intellectual of the 20th century. 
	  
	  With a career spanning the better part of a century, we took the chance to ask Prof. Chomsky his thoughts not only on the progress of linguistics and cognitive science but also the deepest enduring mysteries of science and philosophy as a whole - exploring what may lie beyond our limits of understanding. We also discuss the rise of connectionism and large language models, our quest to discover an intelligible world, and the boundaries between silicon and biology.
	  
	  We explore some of the profound misunderstandings of linguistics in general and Chomsky‚Äôs own work specifically which have persisted, at the highest levels of academia for over sixty years.  
	  
	  We have produced a significant introduction section where we discuss in detail Yann LeCun‚Äôs recent position paper on AGI, a recent paper on emergence in LLMs, empiricism related to cognitive science, cognitive templates, ‚Äúthe ghost in the machine‚Äù and language.
