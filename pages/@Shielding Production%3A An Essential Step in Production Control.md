- [[Abstract]]
	- Effective production control systems are structured around the assignment as the unit of analysis. The quality of work assignments to production units such as construction crews and engineering squads is the key to production control and a key factor determining production unit productivity. Research has revealed that the quality of assignments can be substantially improved by forming and selecting them to meet soundness, sequence, and size criteria. Making quality assignments shields production units from work flow uncertainty, enabling those units to improve their own productivity, and also to improve the productivity of the production units downstream. The associated reduction in task duration can shorten projects. Further reduction of project duration comes from reducing the buffers previously needed to accommodate flow uncertainty.
