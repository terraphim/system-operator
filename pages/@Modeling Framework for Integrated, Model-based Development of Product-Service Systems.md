- [[Abstract]]
	- Product-service systems (PSS) are seen as the 21st-century solution for direct delivery of value to customers under the requirements of high availability, quality, and reduced risks. With mutual benefits for customers, manufacturers, service providers and often the environment, PSS represent a promising approach to sustainable development. This paper addresses the integrated development of product-service systems consisting of physical products/systems and services and proposes an integrated modeling framework that utilizes the Systems Modeling Language. A use case from Lenze, a German automation company, demonstrates the applicability of the integrated modeling framework in practice.
