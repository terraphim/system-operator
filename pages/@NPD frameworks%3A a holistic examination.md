- [[Abstract]]
	- Modern organisations have approached the challenge of innovation by attempting to develop frameworks for new product development. Whilst many organisations have attempted some degree of customisation of these innovation frameworks, most of them retain features of a common skeleton. Indeed in generic terms innovation methodologies exhibit a high degree of similarity. In this paper, presented is an overview of a generic framework that serves to highlight the essential components to make such a system work. The paper goes on to indicate the types of benefits that can be derived from such a system, as well as the limitations and shortcomings of such approaches in practice.
