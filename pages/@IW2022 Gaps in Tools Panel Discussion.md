	  Abstract: Digital Engineering transformation is a buzzword that many are using to try and effect process improvement and tool changes to create efficiencies across their development teams. This transformation is being seen not only in the defense industry but across every industry that produces complex systems which might be electro mechanical or purely software only. Requirements and the management of them is also transforming. Going out are libraries of configuration managed document files replaced by data driven elements residing in requirements tools and modeling tools.
	   
	  With the future of digital engineering ecosystems of tools, what are the future capabilities that our requirements tools vendors need to pay attention to? What mechanisms for data sharing and tool interoperability are required for these ecosystems? What are some of the business constraints should vendors pay attention to?
