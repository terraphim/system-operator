- [[Abstract]]
	- Observations of the ubiquitous problem-solving process have identified the existence of six myths and their corresponding realities. These myths hamper the problem-solver and an understanding of the reality will help the problem-solver to solve problems in a more effective and innovative manner. This paper documents and discusses six myths and their corresponding realities.
