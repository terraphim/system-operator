	- To survive in the economic recession, Japanese organizations looked for alternatives in project management methods as a mean of revivification. P2M is the Japanese version of project and program management, and is the first standard guide for education and certification developed in 2001. KPM is the developed version of P2M. P2M/KPM manages projects and programs based on the mission-driven approach and are proposed to foster development of project management through value creation in a complex and changing environment. It is a project management approach that is comprehensive and adaptable to flexible environmental. It has been proven that flexibility, adaptability, and reformation are essential to survive during an economic crisis. The strategies and methodologies of P2M/KPM have proven to be effective and successful in providing learning opportunities in companies, enhancing participation, and motivating the consensus and awareness of core leaders. Essentially, during the economy downturn, the successful companies were those who applied P2M/KPM methods.
